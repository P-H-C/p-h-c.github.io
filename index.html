<section>
Password hashing is everywhere, from web services' credentials storage
to mobile and desktop authentication or disk encryption systems.
Yet there wasn't an established standard to fulfill the needs of
modern applications and to best protect against attackers.
We started the <a href="#phc">Password Hashing Competition (PHC)</a> to
solve this problem.
<br/>
<br/>
PHC ran from 2013 to 2015 as an open competition&mdash;the same kind of
process as NIST's AES and SHA-3 competitions, and the most effective way
to develop a crypto standard.  We received 24 candidates,
including many excellent designs, and selected one winner,
<a href="#argon2">Argon2</a>, an algorithm designed by Alex Biryukov,
Daniel Dinu, and Dmitry Khovratovich from University of Luxembourg.
<br/>
<br/> 
We recommend that you use Argon2 rather than legacy algorithms.
You'll find the specifications and reference code just below.  <br/>

</ul>
The reference code is C89-compliant C, licensed under <a
href="https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0</a>, a.k.a. public
domain.
It should compile on x86 and x86_64 architectures, as well as most ARM
architectures (except for the code optimized for x86 and x86_64). It
should compile on Linux, OS X, and Windows OS', as well as MinGW
environments.  
<br/>
<br/>
There are two main versions of Argon2, Argon2i and Argon2d. Argon2i is
the safest against side-channel attacks, while Argon2d provides the
highest resistance against GPU cracking attacks.
<br/>
<br/>
Argon2i and Argon2d are parametrized by
<ul>
<li>
A <b>time</b> cost, which defines the execution time
</li>
<li>
A <b>memory</b> cost, which defines the memory usage 
</li>
<li>
A <b>parallelism</b> degree, which defines the number of threads
</li>
</ul>
See the <a
href="https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/blob/master/README.md">README</a>
for detailed instructions. 
You can try Argon2 online on <a href="https://argon2.online/">argon2.online</a>.

Bindings are available for most languages.

<br />
In Q1 2013 we published the <a href="cfh.html">call for
submissions</a>, and by the deadline on March 31, 2014 we had received
<a href="submissions.html">24 submissions</a>. In December 2014 we
shortlisted 9 finalists and published a <a
href="report-finalists.html">short report</a>. In July 2015 we announced
Argon2 as a winner and gave special recognition to four of the
finalists:
<ul>
<li>
<a
href="https://www.uni-weimar.de/de/medien/professuren/mediensicherheit/research/catena/">Catena</a>, for its agile
framework approach and side-channel resistance
(<a href="submissions/Catena-v5.tar.gz">Catena-v5.tar.gz</a>)
</li> 
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyra2">Lyra2</a>, for its elegant
sponge-based design, and alternative approach to side-channel resistance
(<a href="submissions/Lyra2-v3.tar.gz">Lyra2-v3.tar.gz</a>)
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.bolet.org/makwa/">Makwa</a>, for its unique
delegation feature and its factoring-based security
(<a href="submissions/Makwa-v1.tar.gz">Makwa-v1.tar.gz</a>)
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.openwall.com/yescrypt/">yescrypt</a>, for its rich feature set and
easy upgrade path from scrypt 
(<a href="submissions/yescrypt-v2.tar.gz">yescrypt-v2.tar.gz</a>)
